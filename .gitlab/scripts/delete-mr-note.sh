# Delete the merge-request note carrying a marker, if one exists.
#
# Usage: delete-mr-note.sh <marker>
#
# The counterpart to upsert-mr-note.sh. A failure note that stays after the
# failure is fixed is worse than no note: it reports a problem that no longer
# exists, and a reviewer has no way to tell it is stale.
#
# Absence of a matching note is success, not an error: the common case is a
# pipeline that never failed in the first place.
#
# Environment: see mr-note-lib.sh.
